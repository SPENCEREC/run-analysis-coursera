This script reads a few sets of accelerometer data and merges them, names the variables intelligibly, extracts only the mean and standard deviation values, reshapes the data to show the average of each measurement calculation for each participant doing each activity, and finally writes that final reshaped data to a file.

There is only one script, so it is unnecessary to explain how multiple scripts would relate to eachother.

See the CodeBook for details about specific transformations and variables.
